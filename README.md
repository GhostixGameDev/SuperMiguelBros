# SuperMiguelBros
Parody game of one of my School teachers.
Is my first experience with Pygame. So its very experimental. Sorry if it is hardcoded. I try to fix all the hardcoding on
every new commit. Like on the second commit that I started all the project from scratch to fix the hardcoding.


Dependencies for code compiling:
pygame
